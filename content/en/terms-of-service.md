# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "**This Site**" or "**We**")! 👋 Before diving in and using our services, we kindly ask that you carefully read these Terms of Service. By hitting up **This Site** and using our stuff, you're totally agreeing to and accepting everything here.

## 1. About Our Services
**This Site** hooks you up with paid subscription content and membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, ebooks, and community vibes – the whole shebang! Just a heads-up, some content is only for our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   **Users** need to whip up an account with a valid email and a strong password.
*   **Users** are totally responsible for keeping their account secure and for all the shenanigans happening under it. Seriously, 🚨 **no** transferring or sharing accounts!
*   **We** totally reserve the right to hit the pause button or even axe user accounts if anyone's not playing by these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Subscription Services** are billed monthly or annually, and you'll see all the deets on pricing clearly laid out on the checkout page.
*   **All payments** go down through third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. Just so you know, **This Site** doesn't store any of your payment info – we leave that to the pros!
*   **Subscriptions** will 🔄 **auto-renew** like clockwork, unless you hit that cancel button before your current billing cycle wraps up.
*   **Our 14-day refund policy** ✨ is pretty sweet: if you're a first-time subscriber and not vibing with our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us what's up. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, unless the law absolutely says we have to, **no refunds** will be given after payment.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   **All original content** is totally 🔒 **copyrighted by This Site (hubtoday)**. Hands off! You can't copy, repost, or use it for commercial stuff without our say-so.
*   **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access pass** to our content, strictly for personal learning and reading.
*   If you're thinking about **commercial use or dropping a ton of quotes**, just reach out to **This Site** to get the green light.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **It's a big NO-NO 🚫** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on anyone's rights.
*   **Don't even think about** bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking our member-only content using tech tricks.
*   **We** totally have the right to zap inappropriate content and **boot rule-breaking users**.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **We** totally reserve the right to tweak, pause, or pull the plug on any or all of our services whenever we want, without giving you a heads-up.
*   If stuff goes sideways – like an act of God, server hiccups, or third-party service outages making content temporarily unavailable – **This Site** **isn't on the hook** for any compensation. 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer of Warranties
*   **Information provided by This Site** is just for kicks and giggles, strictly for reference. It **doesn't count** as any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.).
*   **This Site** **isn't responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just sayin'.

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted under the laws of California, USA, without fussing over conflict of law principles.
*   **Any disputes** rocking the boat because of or related to these terms should first be sorted out amicably between us. If we can't hug it out, you agree to take it to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California.
