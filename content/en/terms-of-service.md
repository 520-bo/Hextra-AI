# Terms of Service
*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to herein as "the Site" or "we")! Before you dive in and start using our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. Your access or use of the Site means you're totally on board and agree to these terms. 😉

## 1. Service Introduction
This Site offers users paid subscription content and member services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and even community interaction – just to name a few cool things! Some of this awesome content is exclusively for our subscribed users, so get ready to unlock some goodies. 🔓

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account. Easy peasy!
- **Users** are totally responsible for their account's security and all activity happening under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account with anyone else – that's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
- **The Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they're caught violating these terms. You've been warned! 🚨

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, with costs clearly laid out on the checkout page. No surprises there!
- **All payments** are processed securely through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, the Site doesn't store any of your payment info. Your financial deets are safe with them! 🛡️
- **Your subscription** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends. Heads up on that! 🔔
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: First-time subscribers, listen up! If you're not happy with our service within 14 days of your purchase, you can totally apply for a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this refund, so make it count! After 14 days, or if you're not a first-time subscriber, payments are **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise. Fair's fair, right? 😉

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Hands off! You can't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without getting our explicit permission first. Period. 🚫
- **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** this content for personal learning and reading. Keep it personal, folks!
- **For commercial use or extensive quoting**, you'll need to reach out to the Site to snag that authorization. Don't be shy! ✍️

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **It's a definite no-go** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Play nice, seriously! 😇 (Or rather, don't play naughty!)
- **Bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking** member-only content using technical means? Also a huge no-no! We're watching. 👀
- **The Site** has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Consider this your final warning! 🔨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate all or part of our services at any time, without giving you prior notice. Just a heads up on that flexibility!
- **The Site** will **not be liable for compensation** if content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to things totally beyond our control, like force majeure, server malfunctions, or third-party service outages. Tech can be tricky sometimes, folks! 😅

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The information provided by this Site** is purely for reference and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). So don't take it as gospel! 🙅‍♂️
- **The Site** will **not be held responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services. Just keeping it real here! ⚖️

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. So, California law is the boss here! 👑
- **Any disputes** arising out of or related to these terms? We hope to sort them out amicably first. But if we can't hug it out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let the legal eagles fly! 🦅
